Docker Toolbox is old school for macos/win.
It contains virtualbox and runs a few tools in addition to docker for win/mac.

Docker for win/mac requires a hypervisor in the OS.
For mac that is hyperkit, for windows it's hyperv.

Docker CE is perfectly fine for production.
The differentiator that Docker EE has is ability to use a scan when you build your images and access to Docker Data Centre (perhaps that's like a VPS solution?).
